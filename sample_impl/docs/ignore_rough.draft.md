*If a user provides a task, the AI assistant will:*
1. **Map the natural language to an existing task.**
2. **Execute the corresponding task's code and return the output to the user.**

**Code can be anything:** Python code, functions, code in different programming language, or simple terminal commands. It can also be either inputless (doesn't require additional user input) or require input.



**Xact functionalities:**

1. **xact.run:** This function should be able to run any code, command, script, or Python function. If the code requires input, you need to pass it separately.
2. **xact.compose:** The Xact framework will have a sophisticated method to store and organize code files, scripts, Python functions, and commands.

**The Xact framework will come with some pre-defined code, commands, and Python functions built-in.** Users can add their own code files, Python functions, scripts, or commands using xact.compose.

* Each code, command, or script should be in a separate file. A single file can contain multiple Python functions.
* The file itself should include a description, ideally a dictionary or JSON format, containing information such as:
    * Whether the file contains code, script, or Python functions
    * Whether it's inputless or requires input
    * How to pass input and get output
    * A description of the code, command, script, or Python function
* xact.compose can also be used to write and store existing built-in code, commands, scripts, and functions. 
* xact.compose should also have a method to add new files containing code, commands, scripts, or functions, along with their descriptions.

**This Xact framework should be used by the AI assistant to execute tasks.**

**Building an Autonomous AI Assistant Framework (Xact) in Python**

**Concept:**

Xact aims to be a Python framework enabling you to develop an autonomous AI assistant capable of executing tasks based on user prompts. It will bridge the gap between natural language commands and predefined code for task automation.

**Core Functionalities:**

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** (**Not directly implemented in Xact**)

	- This is a crucial component to be implemented outside of Xact, as it's responsible for understanding user prompts and converting them into actionable tasks. Here are common approaches:
		- Intent recognition (identifying user goals)
		- Entity extraction (extracting keywords like date, time, or location)
		- Libraries: Consider libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or TensorFlow Lite for NLP tasks.

2. **Code Execution with xact.run():**

	- This function serves as the heart of Xact, allowing execution of various code types:
		- Python functions, scripts, command-line commands (CMDs)
		- Inputless or input-requiring code (parameters specified separately)
	- Example usage:
		```python
		output = xact.run("my_python_function.py", input_data={"data": "data"})  # Inputless or input-requiring
		```

	3. **Code Management with xact.compose():**
	- This module handles storing and organizing code efficiently:
		- Supports various code types: Python files (.py), shell scripts (.sh), CMD files (.bat), or plain text files (.txt)
		- Each file can contain multiple Python functions, if applicable.
		- File metadata (description) stored in JSON format:
		```json
		{
			"type": "python_function" | "script" | "cmd",
			"input_required": true | false,
			"input_details": { /* ... details on input parameters ... */ },
			"output_format": "text" | "json" | "other",
			"description": "Brief description of the code's functionality"
		}
		```
	- Methods for adding, modifying, and removing code files and metadata.

	**Additional Considerations:**

	- **Security:** Enforce security measures to prevent unauthorized code execution. Consider code sandboxing or whitelisting trusted sources.
	- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected user input or code execution errors.
	- **Extensibility:** Design Xact to be extensible for future enhancements, such as plugin support for additional programming languages or task integrations.

	**Design and Implementation Steps:**

	1. **Project Structure:**

	- Create a Python project directory with the following structure:
		```
		xact/
		__init__.py               # Empty file to mark the directory as a package
		nlp_utils.py              # (Optional) Helper functions for NLP integration (if implemented)
		code_executor.py           # Module for xact.run() functionality
		code_manager.py            # Module for xact.compose() functionality
		utils.py                   # Helper functions for common tasks
		tests/                     # Unit tests for framework components
		```

	2. **xact.run() Implementation:**

	- `code_executor.py` will handle code execution based on code type and parameters.
	- Consider using libraries like `subprocess` (for shell commands), `importlib` (for dynamic Python module loading), or dedicated libraries based on the selected language runtime.

	3. **xact.compose() Implementation:**

	- `code_manager.py` will handle storing code files and their metadata (descriptions) in a suitable format like JSON or a custom class.
	- Implement methods for adding, modifying, and removing code files and metadata.

	4. **AI Assistant Integration:** (**Not directly implemented in Xact**)
	- Integrate Xact with your AI assistant system. The AI assistant performs NLP, maps user intent to Xact code, and calls `xact.run()` when necessary.

	**Example Workflow:**

	1. User issues a voice command: "Set a reminder for 10 PM."
	2. NLP system extracts the task (set a reminder) and due time (10 PM).
	3. AI assistant maps the task to the appropriate code file (e.g., `set_reminder.py`).
	4. If the code requires input (due time in this case), the parameters are passed to `xact.run()`.
	5. Xact executes the defined code, which interacts with the calendar service (not shown
